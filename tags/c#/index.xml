      <description>I wanted to learn how to use web services in .NET with C#, so I created this tiny program that goes out and gets the &amp;ldquo;Dilbert of the Day&amp;rdquo; comic strip and puts it on your desktop in the form of a jpeg file.
There are two versions to this program. One calls the web service synchronously, while the other calls the web services asynchronously. Synchronous calls are what most programmers would be familiar with.</description>

      <description>This application was written to run multiple sql scripts files against an MS Sql Server database. I wrote it to learn more about .NET C# 2 Windows application development.
It is pretty much a work in progress, but it&amp;rsquo;s at a usable point.
