      <description>Ok&amp;hellip;so here it is&amp;hellip;the first of hopefully many applications you can download.
The idea to create this app came to me while I was trying to troubleshoot my uncleâ€™s program that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t connect to his smtp server.
His application was in VB6 and he used it to send out emails from a list of addresses in an Access database. After he switched ISP&amp;rsquo;s he could no longer get it to work since the new provider required him to authenticate before being able to send mail.</description>
