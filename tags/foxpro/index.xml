      <description>This is a very simple label printer application.
Here is how it works:
The user enters a search term, then clicks the search button. The program connects to the Sql Server 2000 database, retrieves the data, and populates the data grid. The user then selects the record desired and the label preview is generated.
On every record selection the preview is automatically generated. The user can then select a modifier by clicking on one of the radio buttons to the right of the preview container.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this app for a while. In fact, this was one of the very first apps I built in Foxpro. I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted it because I wanted to get it cleaned up and add in some of the new things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.
It&amp;rsquo;s basically a file sorting utility that takes files from a specified source directory and its subdirectories, and places them in the destination&amp;rsquo;s subdirectories based on the file&amp;rsquo;s extension.</description>

      <description>Another little program released. This program is for retrieving the HTML of a web page.
After experimenting with the West Wind Internet and Client Tools and then with my own version of a wininet.dll wrapper, I decided the easiest way was to use the WinHTTP service. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know it existed until I found it on Calvin Hsia&amp;rsquo;s Weblog.
Below is the main code of the application. Look at the links provided in the readme for more information on the oHTTP object instantiated in the code.</description>

      <description>Ok&amp;hellip;so here it is&amp;hellip;the first of hopefully many applications you can download.
The idea to create this app came to me while I was trying to troubleshoot my uncleâ€™s program that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t connect to his smtp server.
His application was in VB6 and he used it to send out emails from a list of addresses in an Access database. After he switched ISP&amp;rsquo;s he could no longer get it to work since the new provider required him to authenticate before being able to send mail.</description>
