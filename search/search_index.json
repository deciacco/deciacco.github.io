Sometimes, they will tell you that your account will be suspended unless you update your personal details immediately.

When in doubt, visit the source directly rather than clicking a link in an email.</p> </li> <li> <p>Links - A link may not be all it appears to be. Hovering over a link shows you the actual URL where you will be directed upon clicking on it. It could be completely different or it could be a popular website with a misspelling, for instance www.bankofarnerica.com - the 'm' is actually an 'r' and an 'n', so look carefully.</p> </li> <li> <p>Attachments - If you see an attachment in an email you weren't expecting or that doesn't make sense, don't open it!

If you are an Outlook 2003 or 2007 user, you might have noticed that when you do this, Outlook generates a plain text email with your files attached. </p> <p>While a plain text email is ok, and probably the way all email should be, most of us have been spoiled with html email that allows fancy formatting and we want to keep this functionality when we right-click to send attachments. With this nice formatting ability we also have the added bonus that our signatures get automatically appended to the end of the e-mail.</p> <p>Below are a few steps to create a new Send To Mail Recipient context menu shortcut that address these issues:</p> <ol> <li>Right-Click the START button and select Explore</li> <li> <p>Select the Send To folder from the folder list on the left.</p> <p>Vista Users:  The Send To folder is located under: <code>%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SendTo</code> Everything else should work the same. 3.  Right-Click anywhere in the white space to the right and select New, then Shortcut 4.

In the Type a name for this shortcut: box type in: Outlook Mail Recipient 6.  Now when you right click on items to send as attachments you will have a new option. By selecting Outlook Mail Recipient you will get your new email in the default email format you have selected in Outlook and, if you have configured your signature for a new email, you will have it as well.</p> </li> </ol> <p>UPDATE: 02/10/2009 - It look like this method won't work when selecting multiple files. For a possible workaround try the following:</p> <p>Create a file sendto.js with the following code and save it somewhere on your system.

One calls the web service synchronously, while the other calls the web services asynchronously. Synchronous calls are what most programmers would be familiar with. When a synchronous function/method is called it doesn't return control back to the calling program until it's finished, while an asynchronous function/method returns control immediately while it runs in a separate thread. </p> <p>The synchronous version of this program is much simpler than the asynchronous version, but the later allows for more flexibility.

One of the features of this copier is that it also doubles as a scanner. To scan a document an employee goes to the copier, puts the copier in scanner mode, selects their mailbox from a list and then scans the document. The scanner then sends the scanned information to the scanner software running on one of our servers where the actual file is created and placed in the user's virtual mailbox. (We use pdf as the default.) </p> <p>Each user's virtual mailbox has a folder associated with it, and this folder is located in each user's personal folder on the server. Most of our employees have workstations and their \"My Documents\" folder is mapped to their personal folder on the server. By the time they get back to their desk, all they have to do is go into their \"My Documents\" folder and the scanned document is already there. </p> <p>The problem is with notebook users who don't have a mapped \"My Documents\". If it were mapped, they would not be able to take their documents with them whenever they left the office. So, how can notebook users also retrieve their scanned documents from their \"My Documents\" folder? </p> <p>Basically, all that is needed is some kind of mechanism to monitor a user's virtual mailbox, and when a new file is placed there, copy it down to the user's \"My Documents\" folder on the notebook. </p> <p>PHP Solution:</p> <p>Install PHP on your server/workstation that will be used to run this. (Google \"PHP Install\" for more info...) Php doesn't have a built in way of creating Windows services, hence the \"almost\" in the title. So you can use two nice utilities called INSTSRV.EXE and SRVANY.EXE that come with the Windows Resource Kit. </p> <p>You can download it from here: Windows 2003 Resource Kit Tools </p> <p>Once you've installed the kit you can use something similar to the following to install the service.</p> <pre><code>C:\\Program Files\\Windows Resource Kits\\Tools&gt;instsrv scansmon \"d:\\Program Files\\Windows Resource Kits\\Tools\\srvany.exe\"\n</code></pre> <p>SRVANY does all the work and Windows sees it as the service. SRVANY will look in the registry for the EXE file to use for the service.

Unfortunately, that is where the script failed.</p> <p>At this point I wasn't sure what to do, but I decided I'd give <code>ftp.c</code> another look just in case I had missed something. I started at the top of the file and worked my way down. At first it didn't occur to me, but then I realized that the ftp_login() function might not be the only place where this patch was needed. Sure enough, towards the bottom of the file, I found another function: data_accept(). This made perfect sense, since after the LIST command is sent to the ftp server the actual information is sent through the data channel which is handled by this function.</p> <p>In the data_accept() function I replaced this code:</p> <pre><code>#if HAVE_OPENSSL_EXT\n    SSL_CTX     *ctx;\n#endif\n</code></pre> <p>with this code:</p> <pre><code>#if HAVE_OPENSSL_EXT\n    int errcode;\n    SSL_CTX     *ctx;\n#endif\n</code></pre> <p>Then, in the same function, I replaced this code:</p> <pre><code>if (SSL_connect(data-&gt;ssl_handle) &lt;= 0) {\n    php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, 'data_accept: SSL/TLS handshake failed');\n    SSL_shutdown(data-&gt;ssl_handle);\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>with these lines of code: (Please note that it is slightly different than the previous patch.)</p> <pre><code>do {\n    errcode = SSL_connect(data-&gt;ssl_handle);\n    switch (SSL_get_error (data-&gt;ssl_handle, errcode)) {\n        case SSL_ERROR_NONE:\n            errcode = 1;\n            break;\n        case SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE:\n        case SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ:\n        case SSL_ERROR_WANT_X509_LOOKUP:\n            errcode = 0;\n            break;\n        default:\n            // true error happened\n            php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, 'data_accept: SSL/TLS handshake failed');\n            SSL_shutdown(data-&gt;ssl_handle);\n            return 0;\n            break;\n    }\n} while(errcode == 0 &amp;&amp; !SSL_is_init_finished(data-&gt;ssl_handle));\n</code></pre> <p>After this last patch, I once again recompiled the source and ran the script. This time everything worked as expected, but after some testing I found another issue.</p> <p>Every few directory listings that I pulled down, the connection to the server would be lost. After further investigation I discovered that the cause of this was long directory listings in PASV mode. Every time I pulled a directory listing with more than approximately 5 to 10 files or folders everything was fine, but as soon as the listing contained more than that the connection would unexpectedly close.</p> <p>Start Update: 10/30/2007 I again set out to find the problem. Since this only happened when the directory listing was long, I knew it had something to do with data not fitting inside a container. I started looking for areas in the code where this would be the case, and the first one that I found that made sense to me was this line of code: data = ecalloc(1, sizeof(data)); in the ftp_getdata() function located in the ftp.c file. data is of type databuf_t which is defined in the ftp.h file. I changed the size of this buffer to twice the size from 4096 to 8192. (I was surprised to find out that there was a comment in the code that stated this buffer size should be editable at runtime.) After I recompiled, the error was gone and everything seemed to work normally.</p> <p>After further testing I discovered that I didn't need to have the buffer be twice the size, but simply one byte bigger. From 4096 to 4097. (This is very odd, and I'm sure there is a way to fix this in the code, but I just don't know where)</p> <p>After some testing I discovered that the above is wrong. Changing the buffer caused my SSL communication to break, but because the server was set to handle both ssl or non-ssl connections I did not notice it. I changed the buffer back to the original size of 4096, and I was able to trace the problem to something else:</p> <p>In the my_recv() function at added these lines of code at the beginning of the function:</p> <pre><code>#if HAVE_OPENSSL_EXT\n    int no_error;\n#endif\n</code></pre> <p>and replaced this line of code:</p> <pre><code>nr_bytes = SSL_read(ftp-&gt;data-&gt;ssl_handle, buf, len);\n</code></pre> <p>with these lines:</p> <pre><code>no_error = 1; // there is no error\ndo{\n    nr_bytes = SSL_read(ftp-&gt;data-&gt;ssl_handle, buf, len);\n    switch (SSL_get_error (ftp-&gt;data-&gt;ssl_handle, nr_bytes)) {\n        case SSL_ERROR_NONE:\n        case SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN:\n        case SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE:\n        case SSL_ERROR_WANT_X509_LOOKUP:\n        case SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ:\n            break;\n        case SSL_ERROR_WANT_CONNECT:\n        case SSL_ERROR_WANT_ACCEPT:\n        case SSL_ERROR_SSL:\n        case SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL:\n        default:\n            no_error = 0; //major error, get out\n            break;\n    }\n}while(nr_bytes &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; no_error);\n</code></pre> <p>After SSL_read() was executed I got -1 as the return. A call to SSL_get_error() returned SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ. From what I've been able to find online and the OpenSSL documentation, when this happens, you need to retry the SSL_read() function. After a few retries, the function succeeded and was able to get the data.</p> <p>(I've done some testing and this patch seems to be working reliably.) End Update: 10/30/2007</p> <p>I ran a session with Ghisler's Total Commander which uses the same OpenSSL libraries to make a secure FTP connection, and the server logs looked almost identical to the log generated when connecting with PHP.</p> <p>Here are the main concerns I have:</p>","tags":["PHP","OpenSSL","C","Programming"]},{"location":"posts/PHPOpenSSL/#php-compile","title":"PHP Compile","text":"<ol> <li> <p>What other configuration lines do I really need to get a production ready PHP like what you get from the main PHP downloads site with OpenSSL support included?

Personally, I like to use it in an SSH session to copy what I call \"base\" images of VMs whenever I need a new one. </p> <p>Generally, I'll build a virtual machine with basic settings and create a template or base image. When I have the machine the way I like it, I'll copy it off to a storage folder on the datastore, usually called \"baseimages\".

After he switched ISP's he could no longer get it to work since the new provider required him to authenticate before being able to send mail.
