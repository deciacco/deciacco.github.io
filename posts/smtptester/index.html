<p>The idea to create this app came to me while I was trying to troubleshoot my uncle’s program that wouldn&rsquo;t connect to his smtp server.</p>
<p>His application was in VB6 and he used it to send out emails from a list of addresses in an Access database. After he switched ISP&rsquo;s he could no longer get it to work since the new provider required him to authenticate before being able to send mail. I didn&rsquo;t know all the inner workings of communicating with an SMTP server, but I was able to figure out that we needed to send the AUTH command and then in some way the username and password.</p>
<p>Not having enough time to fix it I went home later that evening and started researching. To make it more interesting I decided to create a little tool that I could use to learn with as well as use later. I decided to use Foxpro to develop the program for two main reasons.</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;ve only been using it for about a year, so I needed the practice. Second, I wanted to develop an application that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally see written in Foxpro. Most Foxpro apps, at least from what I can tell so far, are data driven applications. Many smaller companies out there tend to use Foxpro because it is relatively inexpensive, yet extremely flexible and super fast, especially when it comes to dealing with data.</p>
<p>I also hope that by developing these little tools, I can help make people more aware that Foxpro is out there and can be used for a variety of projects.</p>
